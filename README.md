# **Part 4: Creativity and Curiosity**

## Introduction

The current Kanban Board web app serves as a very basic and simple tool for managing tasks using the Kanban methodology. To enhance its functionality and usability, I propose transforming it into a full SaaS  project management tool similar to Jira(bu without any need to configure physical server installation). This enhanced tool will provide advanced project management features, including task tracking, team collaboration, and reporting, all accessible through a web browser.

## Proposed Features

### 1. Multi-Project Support

**Description:** Allow users to create and manage multiple projects within the same account. **Implementation:**

-   Use a relational database to manage projects and their relationships with users and tasks.
-   Update the UI to support project selection and navigation.

### 2. User Authentication and Roles

**Description:** Implement user authentication(through Google, Github and x.com) and role-based access control to ensure secure and organized project management. **Implementation:**

-   Integrate OAuth for authentication and JWT for session management.
-   Define roles (e.g., Admin, Project Manager, Developer, DevOps, etc) and permissions for different actions within the application.
-   Update the UI to show/hide features based on user roles.

### 3. Advanced Task Management

**Description:** Enhance task management capabilities with features like task dependencies, priorities, and due dates. **Implementation:**

-   Extend the task schema to include new attributes.
-   Update the task management module to handle dependencies and priorities.
-   Enhance the Kanban board UI to visually represent these features.

### 4. Team Collaboration Tools

**Description:** Add real-time collaboration features such as comments, notifications, and file attachments. **Implementation:**

-   Use WebSocket  for real-time updates.
-   Integrate a rich-text editor for comments and file upload functionality.
-   Implement an in-app notification system and e-mail(or even mobile phone) notifications for important updates.

## Technologies and Tools

### Frontend:

-   **React.js** for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
-   **Redux** for state management.
-   **Material-UI** for a consistent and modern UI design.

### Backend:

-   **Django** for building RESTful APIs.
-   **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL** for database management.
-   **Celery** for handling background tasks and notifications.

### Deployment:

-   **Docker(Or Cloud-based alternatives)** for containerization.
-   **Kubernetes(Or Cloud-based alternatives)** for orchestration and scaling.
-   **Google Cloud Platform(AWS, Azure)** for hosting and managing the SaaS infrastructure.
- **Jenkins** for more professional build of ci/cd pipelines then GitHub Actions.

## Benefits

### Scalability:

Transforming the application into a SaaS model allows it to handle multiple projects and users efficiently, making it suitable for businesses of all sizes.

### Collaboration:

Real-time collaboration features improve team productivity and communication, making it easier to track project progress and address issues faster and more precisely.

### Security:

Implementing robust authentication and role-based access control ensures that project data is secure and accessible only to authorized users.


## Conclusion

Transforming the Kanban Board application into a full SaaS project management tool will significantly enhance its utility and appeal to real customers and businesses. By implementing these proposed features and using modern technologies, it ispossible to create a powerful tool that meets the needs of diverse teams and projects.
